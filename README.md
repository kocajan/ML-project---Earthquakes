## Project Overview  
This project was completed as part of a semester assignment aimed at developing an **analytical report** based on a self-chosen dataset. I selected a dataset containing records of over **3 million earthquakes** worldwide from **1990 to 2023**.  

The main objectives of this assignment were to:  
- Explore the data and assess its quality.  
- Formulate research hypotheses.  
- Apply data cleaning and necessary transformations.  
- Build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict earthquake significance based on features like **magnitude** and **depth**.  
- Draw conclusions from the analysis.
